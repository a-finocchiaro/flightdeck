# FlightDeck

Currently still in development.

A Terminal UI for flight tracking using [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview). For now, the data all comes from Flightradar24.

## Disclaimer

I wanted to write this mainly as a way to get better at Go programming and did this for educational purposes. This is designed to be only for educational and tinkering only and not for commercial use.

Please look at the [Flightradar24 ToS](https://www.flightradar24.com/terms-and-conditions) for more information. Also for commercial purposes, Flightradar24 offers an [API](https://fr24api.flightradar24.com/).

This is just something cool I wanted to build in my free time that interests me and thought other ADSB and technical avgeeks might enjoy!

## Feature List
